# IOD_Capstone_Project_Presentation
The final project of my data science and ai bootcamp with the Institute of Data.

With the drug review dataset from UCI ([[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/462](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/462/drug+review+dataset+drugs+com)](url)), I have designed a pipeline to download, visualise descriptive statistics, perform exploratory data analysis, preprocess the data into usable forms, tested multiple machine and deep learning models, analysed customer/product relationships, identified potential areas of the market to investigate, and created a rudimentary gradio app to predict customer sentiment with reviews.
